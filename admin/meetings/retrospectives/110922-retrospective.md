## Retrospective 1
### Date: Nov 9 and 12 2022
### What went well?
- We were able to succesfully split up and delegate tasks
- Decided on an overall design (visually and functionally)
- We got a strong start on all the different components of the website
- Going through the updated wireframes and having more updated messaging
- Wireframe and Webpage matched
- We have a clear idea on what the final product will be
- Get started at the page
- We managed to do our tasks and discussed about our websites design.
- Every task is delegated and good progress on the front-end
### What didn't go well?
- We didn't document everything us much as we should
- Split unit testing into a separate group when they should be working with everyone
- Hard to communicate with everyone/TA when doing zoom/in-person meeting
- Need better communication with TA
- ADR on naming unclear
- There's some confusion here and there between the different subgroups
- Not much pairing between the front end and back end to make sure the algorithm flow correctly
- Haven't decide on some design part
- Without much knowledge about the front-end, the back-end wasn't able to make much progress. We didn't know what exactly to test on so our CI/CD pipeline has not been updated
- Unable to get full attendance at meetings which makes it hard for everyone to be on the same page
